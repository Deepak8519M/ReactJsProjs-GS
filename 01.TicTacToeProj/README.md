# 🎯 Tic Tac Toe Game in React

A sleek and fully functional **Tic Tac Toe** game made using **React**, built with clean structure and simple logic for local two-player fun!

## 🌟 Key Highlights

- 🔲 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board
- 👨‍👩‍👧 Two-player support
- 🧠 Win checking logic using basic conditions
- 🔒 Game locks after a win to prevent further clicks
- ✨ Simple, readable, and extendable codebase

---

## 🧩 How It Works

- Each click triggers a state update and alternates between "X" and "O".
- We use a `data` array to track board values.
- Win is detected by checking specific index combinations:

```js
if (data[0] === data[1] && data[1] === data[2] && data[2] !== "") {
  won(data);
}
```

> The condition `data[i] !== ""` ensures empty cells are not counted as winning.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- ⚛️ React (Hooks + Functional Components)
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS (optional but makes UI nice)
- 🧠 Vanilla JS logic for game rules

## ✅ How Win Detection Works

In `checkWin()`, we compare values of each winning combination:

```js
if (data[0] === data[1] && data[1] === data[2] && data[2] !== "") {
  won(data);
}
```

If three cells match and are not empty, a win is declared!
