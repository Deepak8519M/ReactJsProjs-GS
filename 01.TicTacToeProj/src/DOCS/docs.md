You're totally right to wonder that ‚Äî **you *did* give a space**, so let‚Äôs clarify **why it still doesn't show up**.

---

### üîç Here's what you wrote:

```jsx
<h1 className="title">
  Tic Tac Toe Game in <span>React</span>
</h1>
```

It looks like there **is a space after "in"** ‚Äî so why does it render as `inReact`?

---

### ‚úÖ Answer:

Even though you *visually* wrote a space after `"in"`, in **JSX**, the way whitespace is handled is a little different.

#### JSX treats:

* **Spaces between text and JSX tags** as **insignificant** unless there's **text between them**.
* JSX **does not auto-merge** spaces when rendering.

So JSX treats this:

```jsx
"Tic Tac Toe Game in" <span>React</span>
```

as:

* one text node: `"Tic Tac Toe Game in"`
* and one span element: `<span>React</span>`

But it does **not insert any space** between them automatically.

---

### ‚úÖ Fix:

To make the space show up, you need to **explicitly add the space** **inside the text**, **or as a separate space character node**.

#### Option 1 ‚Äì Add space inside the string:

```jsx
"Tic Tac Toe Game in "  // Notice space *inside* the string
```

```jsx
<h1 className="title">
  Tic Tac Toe Game in <span>React</span>
</h1>
```

This works **only if there's a literal space before the `<span>`**.

---

#### Option 2 ‚Äì Add `{" "}` (JSX space)

This is the **safest and cleanest** way:

```jsx
<h1 className="title">
  Tic Tac Toe Game in{" "}<span>React</span>
</h1>
```

* `{" "}` tells JSX to **render an actual space character** between the two.

---

### ‚úÖ Final Working Example:

```jsx
<h1 className="title">
  Tic Tac Toe Game in{" "}
  <span>React</span>
</h1>
```

‚úîÔ∏è Output: `Tic Tac Toe Game in React` (with proper space)
